# Workshop Module Federation
Welcome to this workshop about Module Federation. Module Federation is a JavaScript architecture design pattern that
allows a JavaScript application to dynamically run code from another bundle/build. This is the foundation of Micro Frontends
and Microservices architecture, enabling different teams to work on different parts of an application and deploy their code independently.

In this workshop you will build and host your own micro frontend. When you are done, you will have a working micro frontend
that can be dynamically loaded into this host application.

This workshop uses Angular and the Module Federation plugin for Webpack.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Angular CLI
- Ngrok to host your micro frontend from your dev machine (https://ngrok.com/download)

## Getting started
1. Clone the remote base project repository: (https://github.com/janverhoeckx/workshop-module-federation-remote)
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the remote application
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. You should see the remote application running.

## Build your micro frontend

## Host and integrate your micro frontend into the shell application
1. Start your remote with `npm start`
2. Host your micro frontend with ngrok: `ngrok http 4201`
3. Provide the public URL of your shell application to the shell application owner
